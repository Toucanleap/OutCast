OutCast
=======

A small game that is about a modern-day outcast. Previously a big broadcasting name, now an unknown identity. 
How will he regain his life, why has this happened? Who is responsible?

OutCast is a game to be developed by Pigeon's Play, a small, currently one man studio.
The goal for OutCast is to develop it purely through contributions and comments on Github. 
This would allow the game to be completely open source. We need your help.
